Just an static web about me (made with Kotlin Multiplatform)

## Build and Run Web Application

To build and run the development version of the web app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE's toolbar or run it directly from the terminal:
- for the Wasm target (faster, modern browsers):
  - on macOS/Linux
    ```shell
    ./gradlew deployToDocs --no-configuration-cache
    ```
And then push (deployment only built in main branch)
